                Some of the things that I am most passionate about in life are
                music (listening to and collecting vinyl), sneaker collecting
                (hoarding in the eyes of some), coffee, the 76ers, veganism (4
                years strong!), weightlifting, cycling, and of course, my
                friends and family ‚ù§

              <h1 className="pt-3 header-text">music</h1>
              <p className="pt-3 main-text">
                I think a person's taste in music says a lot of them. Here are
                some of my favorite artists (new and old): Bob Dylan, LCD
                Soundsystem, Nas, Yung Lean, Kaytranada, Sufjan Stevens, Wilco,
                Whitney, Daft Punk, The Beatles, The Grateful Dead, HOMESHAKE,
                Henry Mancini, The Postal Service, Glenn Miller, MGMT...

              <p className="pt-3 main-text">
                This year I've really been pushing myself to read more. So far I
                have read some fantastic books. Some of my favorites have been
                The Winter Fortress by Neal Bascomb, The Doors of Perception by
                Aldous Huxley, Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World
                by Haruki Murakami, The Third Policeman by Flann O'Brien, Born a
                Crime by Trevor Noah, and On the Road by Jack Kerouac. I'm now
                reading How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy by
                Jenny Odell.

              <h1 className="pt-3 header-text">film</h1>
              <p className="pt-3 main-text">
                Movies are a big part of my life, too. I don't watch them all
                too often, but some of my favorites are Yellow Submarine,
                Raising Arizona, A Town Called Panic, and Full Metal Jacket.
